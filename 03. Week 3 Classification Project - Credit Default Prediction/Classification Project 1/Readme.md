### Problem Statement 

### Data Source and The Data 
Description of the data and the data generating mechanism 

### General EDA - Different (Notebook) 

### ML Based EDA 
- Plots of Outliers
- Plots of Feature Combinations 
### Processing Steps 
SMOTE - Diagramatic representation (How SMOTE Works) 

### ML Modelling 
I tried non-linear models abcd, I also tried a linear model e which as predicted 

I chose this model 
How does this model work 
(Non-Parametric) 
Tree Based 
BAGGING 


### Tuned Your Model 

### Used the best params to predict (unseen Data) 

### Evaluate 

- Plotted some learning curves
- 80%

- Mispredicted Error Analysis
